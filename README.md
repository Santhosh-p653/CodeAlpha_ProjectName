How It Works

1. Enter your text in the input field  
2. Select source and target languages  
3. Click Translate 
4. Get instant output thanks to API power  

All handled in-browser â€” no page reloads, no fuss.


A need for quick translation without ads, noise, or distractions â€” and a chance to flex front-end magic with API logic. This is part of a broader journey into UI/UX design and smart integrations.
